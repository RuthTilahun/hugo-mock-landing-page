> Data Colelction Tool

- 🛡️ Security aware

  Get A+ scores on Mozilla Observatory out of the box. Easily change the default Security Headers to suit your needs.

- ⚡ Fast by default

  Get 100 scores on Google Lighthouse by default. Hugo Bootstrap Theme removes unused css, prefetches links, and lazy loads images.

- 📈 SEO-ready

  Use sensible defaults for structured data, open graph, and Twitter cards. Or easily change the Search Engine Optimization settings to your liking.

Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filipecarneiro/hugo-bootstrap-theme) for the release notes.
